### Pokedex-App

This is a simple web application I built as I was learning to become a full stack web developer with CareerFoundry.

### Built with:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

### Description:

The pokedex-app loads data from external Pok√©API and shows details of Pokemons by click in a modal.  
The user also can search live for a specific Pokemon.
